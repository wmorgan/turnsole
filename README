Turnsole is a curses client for Heliotrope, the personal email server.

Turnsole is still under development. As such, there is no gem yet. You will
have to run it the hard way:

0.  Install Heliotrope. See the README at http://github.com/wmorgan/heliotrope.
1.  Start Heliotrope.
2.  Run `git clone https://github.com/wmorgan/turnsole.git`.
3.  Install the following gems: trollop console locale rmail rest-client.
4.1 If you are on OS X 10.6, also install the snowleopard-ncurses gem.
4.2 If you are on Linux, also install the ncursesw gem.

Run turnsole liek this:
  ruby -I lib -I <heliotrope repo>/lib bin/turnsole

After the first invocation, you should edit ~/.turnsole/config.yaml to
set any defaults.

SPECIAL NOTES FOR OS X
----------------------

Certain versions of Ruby, on OS X, appear to exhibit bugs in Fibers,
which turnsole uses extensively.

- Ruby 1.8.7 works fine (Turnsole includes a Fiber backport).
- Ruby 1.9.2-p280 fails.
- Ruby 1.9.3-p0 works, but you cannot compile with llvm-gcc. Unfortunately,
if you have XCode installed, this is the default. (See http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/40574 .)
If you're using rvm to install, try this:
  CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p0
I managed to get that working.
