Turnsole is a curses client for Heliotrope, the personal email server.

Turnsole is still under development. As such, there is no gem yet. You will
have to run it the hard way:

0.  Install Heliotrope. See the README at http://github.com/wmorgan/heliotrope.
1.  Start Heliotrope.
2.  Run `git clone https://github.com/wmorgan/turnsole.git`.
3.  Install the bundler gem and install the needed gems:
      $ gem install bundler
      $ bundle install

    If bundler doesn't work for you, you can read the needed gems in the
    Gemfile and install them.

    Note that ncursesw is for Linux; OSX Snowleopard and Lion are said
    to need the snowleopard-ncurses gem instead.

Run turnsole like this:
  ruby -I lib -I <heliotrope repo>/lib bin/turnsole

After the first invocation, you should edit ~/.turnsole/config.yaml to
set any defaults.

SPECIAL NOTES FOR OS X
----------------------

Certain versions of Ruby, on OS X, appear to exhibit bugs in Fibers,
which turnsole uses extensively.

- Ruby 1.8.7 works fine (Turnsole includes a Fiber backport).
- Ruby 1.9.2-p280 fails.
- Ruby 1.9.3-p0 works, but you cannot compile with llvm-gcc. Unfortunately,
if you have XCode installed, this is the default. (See http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/40574 .)
If you're using rvm to install, try this:
  CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p0
I managed to get that working.
